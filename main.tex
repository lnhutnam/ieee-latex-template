    \begin{abstract}
        The performance of an operating system (OS) is
        affected by the algorithm policy that is used by a CPU
        to schedule the running processes.~Thus, a better CPU
        scheduling algorithm results in faster OS performance
        using minimal resources over small amounts of time [11].
        For that reason, many algorithms were proposed and implemented
        to enhance the performance of CPU scheduling.~Round Robin is
        considered an efficient and fair algorithm because all
        processes are given the same amount of time quantum.
        However, its efficiency depends on the selected time quantum.
        In this paper, we present a comparative study of four different
        Round Robin algorithms namely: Adaptive Round Robin Algorithm,
        Best Time Quantum Round Robin CPU Scheduling, Optimal Round
        Robin Scheduling Using Manhattan Distance Algorithm, and
        Improved Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm.~We compare these
        algorithms in terms of four performance factors including:
        Average Waiting Time (AWT), Average Turnaround Time (ATT),
        Average Response Time (ART)~and Number of Contexts Switching (NCS).
        The simulation results show that both Adaptive Round Robin
        and Optimal Round Robin Scheduling Using Manhattan Distance
        algorithms are more efficient to be adopted as they recorded
        the minimum values of performance factors.

    \section{Related Work}
    \label{sec:related-work}
    In the last decade, several approaches and solutions tried to
    address the efficient utilization of CPU scheduling algorithms
    for processes and jobs (tasks) of the OS. For instance, authors
    of [4] provided a survey study that compared between four
    different algorithms (AAIRR, ERR, AAIRR and ERR).~Each
    algorithm is executed using static and dynamic time quantum.
    Also, there are three cases of generating burst time in case 1
    the burst time was generated randomly, in case 2 burst time
    was generated randomly but in a decreasing order and in case
    3 the burst time was generated randomly but in an ascending
    order.~It is assumed that all processes arrive at the same time
    (arrival time = 0).~The authors use two criteria to examine the
    performance of all four algorithms which is ART and ATT.\\

    Also, in [9] authors compared between two different
    algorithms which are the Improved Round Robin (IRR) which
    has dynamic time quantum, and the basic round-robin which
    has static time quantum.~Selecting the optimal algorithm was
    based on three factors which are AWT, ATT and NCS. The
    experiment has two ceases in case 1 the arrival time is equal
    to 0, and the burst time is generated in an acceding order,
    descending order and random.~In case 2 the arrival time is
    different, and the burst time is generated in an acceding order,
    descending order and random.\\

    There are some limitations in these two researches such
    as in [4] the authors only use two factors in the compression
    between the four algorithms which are AWT and ATT however
    in our research we add two more important factors ART
    and NCS. In [9] Authors compared between two different
    algorithms using three criteria AWT, ATT and NCS however
    the method of generating the burst time, and the arrival time
    was not mentioned.~In our research, we used exponential
    distribution, and the reason of using such a model is explained in
    the next section, Section III, ROUND-ROBIN SCHEDULING
    ALGORITHMS.\@


    \section{Conclusion and Remarks}
    \label{sec:conclusion-and-remarks}
    In conclusion, many Round Robin algorithms were
    developed to maximize the efficiency of the CPU scheduling.
    Therefore, there is a necessity to compare between them by
    evaluating their performance using some criteria such as AWT,
    ATT, ART and NCS. For that reason, this paper compared
    between four different types of RR algorithm.~The simulation
    results showed that both Adaptive Round Robin Algorithm and
    Optimal Round Robin based Manhattan Distance Algorithm
    are more efficient CPU scheduling techniques than Best Time
    Quantum Round Robin CPU Scheduling and Improved Round
    Robin Scheduling Algorithm since they recorded the best
    performance results.
